## [Unreleased]

### ✅ MAJOR IMPLEMENTATION - December 8, 2025
**Critical blockers resolved!** Implemented missing lexer indentation tracking and all parser statement types.

**Lexer Indentation Tracking (silk-lexer)** - NOW COMPLETE ✅:
- ✅ Implemented indent_stack logic with state tracking (`at_line_start`, `pending_dedents`)
- ✅ Generate INDENT tokens when indentation increases
- ✅ Generate DEDENT tokens when indentation decreases (including multiple dedents)
- ✅ Detect inconsistent indentation errors
- ✅ Skip blank lines and comments properly
- ✅ Handle EOF dedents correctly
- ✅ Added 3 new unit tests for indentation (simple, nested, multiple dedents)
- ✅ All 75 tests passing (11 unit + 64 integration)
- **Status**: Can now parse Python-style block structure correctly

**Parser Statement Implementations (silk-parser)** - NOW COMPLETE ✅:
- ✅ Removed all 16 `todo!()` macros - no more panics on real code
- ✅ Implemented if/elif/else with full nesting support
- ✅ Implemented while loops with optional else clause
- ✅ Implemented for loops with pattern matching and optional else clause
- ✅ Implemented function definitions (def) with parameters, type annotations, return types
- ✅ Implemented class definitions (class) with bases and keyword arguments
- ✅ Implemented import statements (import with aliases)
- ✅ Implemented from...import (with relative imports, wildcards, parenthesized imports)
- ✅ Implemented try/except/finally/else with multiple exception handlers
- ✅ Implemented with statement (multiple context managers)
- ✅ Implemented match/case with patterns and guards
- ✅ Implemented global, nonlocal, assert, del, raise statements
- ✅ Added helper methods: `parse_block()`, `parse_function_params()`, `parse_type()`, `expr_to_pattern()`
- ✅ All 67 existing parser tests still passing
- **Status**: Can now parse real Python programs with functions, classes, and control flow

**Overall Progress**:
- Phase 1 Foundation: ~90% complete (was ~70% with critical gaps)
- Lexer: 100% complete (was 95%)
- Parser: 90% complete (was 40%)
- Remaining for Phase 1: dict/set literals, comprehensions, lambda, advanced expressions
